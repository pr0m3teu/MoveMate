> The more we get to know the Discourse platform, the more we fall in love with it. Itâs simple and intuitive, but much more powerful than you imagine. We donât know how many times we got lost cruising around checking out all the features. And, as a plus, we really enjoy working with the Discourse team.

> I wanna shout out the team at [@discourse](https://twitter.com/discourse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Often we see Twitter used as a resource to commiserate on bad experiences with services but itâs wonderful to amplify the extraordinary. Every time Iâve needed help, the team at Discourse has been super responsive and helpful. Yâall rock.
