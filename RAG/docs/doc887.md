### @jnaulty **[jnaulty](/jnaulty)** commented [Nov 20, 2025](#issue-3648233610) • edited Loading Uh oh! There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

## Description

* Add `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` flag to `become-candidate`, `join-committee`, `leave-committee`, `update-metadata`, `update-gas-price`, and `report-validator` commands in `sui validator` CLI.
* This allows users to generate unsigned transactions for offline signing or multisig operations.
* Update validator\_tool.md documentation to include instructions for offline signing and using multisig accounts.

## Test plan

Short Script to Test

```move
#!/bin/bash
# Test script for validator commands with --serialize-unsigned-transaction flag

# Ensure we are in the root of the repo
if [ ! -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
    echo "Please run this script from the root of the repository."
    exit 1
fi

# Build the binary if needed (optional, assuming it's already built from previous steps)
# cargo build --bin sui

SUI_BINARY="./target/debug/sui"

echo "Testing validator commands with --serialize-unsigned-transaction..."

# 1. Make validator info (setup)
echo "Generating validator info..."
$SUI_BINARY validator make-validator-info "Test Validator" "Description" "http://image.url" "http://project.url" "localhost" 1000

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to generate validator info."
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Test become-candidate
echo "Testing become-candidate serialization..."
OUTPUT=$($SUI_BINARY validator become-candidate validator.info --serialize-unsigned-transaction)
if [[ "$OUTPUT" == *"Serialized transaction for signing"* ]]; then
    echo "PASS: become-candidate serialized successfully."
else
    echo "FAIL: become-candidate failed to serialize."
    echo "$OUTPUT"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Test update-gas-price
echo "Testing update-gas-price serialization..."
OUTPUT=$($SUI_BINARY validator update-gas-price 1000 --serialize-unsigned-transaction)
if [[ "$OUTPUT" == *"Serialized transaction for signing"* ]]; then
    echo "PASS: update-gas-price serialized successfully."
else
    echo "FAIL: update-gas-price failed to serialize."
    echo "$OUTPUT"
    exit 1
fi

# 4. Test join-committee
echo "Testing join-committee serialization..."
OUTPUT=$($SUI_BINARY validator join-committee --serialize-unsigned-transaction)
if [[ "$OUTPUT" == *"Serialized transaction for signing"* ]]; then
    echo "PASS: join-committee serialized successfully."
else
    echo "FAIL: join-committee failed to serialize."
    echo "$OUTPUT"
    exit 1
fi

# 5. Test leave-committee
# Note: This might fail if the local state doesn't see the active address as a validator, 
# but the serialization check happens before execution in some paths, or after checks.
# Based on implementation, it checks status first. So this might fail if not a validator.
# We'll skip this one if we can't easily mock the validator state, or we expect it to fail.
# However, for the purpose of this script, we can try and see.
echo "Testing leave-committee serialization (expecting failure if not active validator)..."
$SUI_BINARY validator leave-committee --serialize-unsigned-transaction > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "INFO: leave-committee failed as expected (not an active validator)."
else
    echo "PASS: leave-committee serialized (unexpected if not validator, but good if it worked)."
fi

# Clean up
rm -f validator.info protocol.key account.key network.key worker.key

echo "All tests passed!"
```

What do you think about keeping it the same as in `sui client side`

Suggested change

Ditto. We probably want to make this a TxProcessingArgs struct, instead of copying them across commands.

Suggested change

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | /// If true, only print the unsigned transaction and do not execute it. |
|  | /// This is useful for offline signing. |
|  | // Arguments related to transaction arguments. |
|  | #[derive(Args, Debug, Default)] |
|  | pub struct TxProcessingArgs { |
|  | /// Instead of executing the transaction, serialize the bcs bytes of the unsigned transaction data |
|  | /// (TransactionData) using base64 encoding, and print out the string <TX\_BYTES>. The string can |
|  | /// be used to execute transaction with `sui client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes <TX\_BYTES>`. |
|  | #[arg(long)] |
|  | pub serialize\_unsigned\_transaction: bool, |
|  | /// Gas budget for this transaction |
|  | #[clap(name = "gas-budget", long)] |
|  | gas\_budget: Option<u64>, |
|  | } |

Then we can use it as

```move
JoinCommittee {
    #[clap(flatten)]
    tx_args: TxProcessingArgs
}
```

Is this the desired behaviour to output the serialized transaction if there's no response, without checking if serialized\_unsigned\_transaction is set?

Left a few comments around ergonomics, but other than that, looks reasonably straightforward. Thanks [@jnaulty](https://github.com/jnaulty)!
