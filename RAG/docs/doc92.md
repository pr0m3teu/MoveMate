# The Move Reference

Welcome to Move, a next generation language for secure asset programming. Its primary use case is in
blockchain environments, where Move programs are used to construct state changes. Move allows
developers to write programs that flexibly manage and transfer assets, while providing the security
and protections against attacks on those assets. However, Move has been developed with use cases in
mind outside a blockchain context as well.

Move takes its cue from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using resource types with move (hence
the name) semantics as an explicit representation of digital assets, such as currency.
