Code Review

# Write better code

On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.

[Get started](/pricing)[Contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcode-review&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)

## Every change starts with a pull request.

![The image shows a GitHub interface for opening a pull request. It features dropdown menus for selecting base and compare branches, a green checkmark indicating automatic merge capability, a text box for comments, and formatting options.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4Yix4uMLoiBvceROXWNmKR/f431df88645e52013f22009ff36287ab/code-review-hero.webp)

Every change starts with a pull request.

[Learn pull request fundamentals](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

* *Start a new feature or propose a change to existing code with a pull request*—a base for your team to coordinate details and refine your changes.
* *Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on GitHub.* Evolve projects, propose new features, and discuss implementation details before changing your source code.

## See every update and act on it, in-situ

### [Diffs](/features/code-review)

![This image visually represents changes made to a stylesheet file, highlighting how the layout or design of a web page might be altered through these CSS adjustments.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5pCFaCWGtdv0Iw54rBJwHO/2f18ef4ccccb66246fe868248ba8028b/code-review-card-1.webp?fm=webp)

Preview changes in context with your code to see what is being proposed. Side-by-side Diffs highlight added, edited, and deleted code right next to the original file, so you can easily spot changes.

### [History](https://docs.github.com/articles/searching-commits/)

![Screenshot of two commits added, and the changes were approved.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4luU1oFeKjXOanl31tsAM6/5c243e5d9571e7b6aa4fc1666c510875/code-review-cards-2.webp?fm=webp)

Browse commits, comments, and references related to your pull request in a timeline-style interface. Your pull request will also highlight what’s changed since you last checked.

### [Blame](https://docs.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/)

![Image showing a file history showing four version entries with names and timestamps: 'First draft' and 'delete old pricing,' modified over the past few months.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/ZOTraojb6dTMPcRuAi8XY/af2f058b119e355c7e7ba5a34b29abe9/code-review-cards-3.webp?fm=webp)

See what a file looked like before a particular change. With blame view, you can see how any portion of your file has evolved over time without viewing the file’s full history.

## Discuss code within your code

### Comments

On GitHub, conversations happen alongside your code. Leave detailed comments on code syntax and ask questions about structure inline.

![The image shows a section of a user interface. At the top, there is a list with three items: "Line 10: Layouts" with a minus sign in red, "Line 11: Grid system" with a plus sign in green, and "Line 12: Layout are built on a 12 column grids." Below this list, there is a comment from the user "rajqflow" made 1 day ago that says, "Good cal, this is more specific!" The comment has received 5 thumbs-up likes and 2 heart reactions.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5gnwahjQ9gKBypJnMcLydF/0974d401891ea65109401c2678a71be7/features-code-review-river-1.webp)

### Review requests

If you’re on the other side of the code, requesting peer reviews is easy. Add users to your pull request, and they’ll receive a notification letting them know you need their feedback.

![The image shows a user interface for requesting a review. At the top, there is a text box with the placeholder "Request a review" and an input field below it containing the letter "o". Underneath the input field, there are two user suggestions: "kharyrizen Raymonda Khouri" with an avatar of a person, and "hankzolo Hank Zoeng" with an avatar of another person. ](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/67J4cJ8c4yrByoJ2R6arIy/d0520dc3a7c6596a94555ee32949a112/features-code-review-river-2.webp)

### Reviews

Save your teammates a few notifications. Bundle your comments into one cohesive review, then specify whether comments are required changes or just suggestions.

![The image displays a notification message. The notification features a red circle with a white 'X' icon and the title "Review required." Below the title, it states, "At least one approve review is required by reviewers to write access. Learn more." Additionally, there is an avatar of a person with the username "khayrizen" and text indicating that this user was requested for review.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/1g98EDjmSXX2a2bgJTJHSJ/66ba98c7358a1033981f9d8a166304dd/features-code-review-river-3.webp)

### *You can’t always avoid conflict.* Merge pull requests faster by resolving simple merge conflicts on GitHub—no command line necessary.

## Merge the highest quality code

Reviews can improve your code, but mistakes happen. Limit human error and ensure only high quality code gets merged with detailed permissions and status checks.

### [Fast, relevant results](/pricing)

Give collaborators as much access as they need through your repository settings. You can extend access to a few teams and select which ones can read or write to your files. The options you have for permissions depend on your plan.

See plan options

### [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)

Protected Branches help you maintain the integrity of your code. Limit who can push to a branch, and disable force pushes to specific branches. Then scale your policies with the Protected Branches API.

Learn more

### [Required status checks](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses)

Create required status checks to add an extra layer of error prevention on branches. Use the Status API to enforce checks and disable the merge button until they pass. To err is human; to automate, divine!
