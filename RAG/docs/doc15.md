# Package

Move is a language for writing smart contracts - programs that are stored and run on the blockchain.
A single program is organized into a package. A package is published on the blockchain and is
identified by an [address](/concepts/address). A published package can be interacted with by sending
[transactions](/concepts/what-is-a-transaction) calling its functions. It can also act as a dependency for
other packages.

Package consists of modules - separate scopes that contain functions, types, and other items.

```move
package 0x...  
    module a  
        struct A1  
        fun hello_world()  
    module b  
        struct B1  
        fun hello_package()
```

## Package Structure[​](#package-structure "Direct link to Package Structure")

Locally, a package is a directory with a Move.toml file and a sources directory. The Move.toml
file - called the "package manifest" - contains metadata about the package, and the sources
directory contains the source code for the modules. Package usually looks like this:

```move
sources/  
    my_module.move  
    another_module.move  
    ...  
tests/  
    ...  
examples/  
    using_my_module.move  
Move.toml
```

The tests directory is optional and contains tests for the package. Code placed into the tests
directory is not published on-chain and is only available in tests. The examples directory can be
used for code examples, and is also not published on-chain.

## Published Package[​](#published-package "Direct link to Published Package")

During development, package doesn't have an address and it needs to be set to 0x0. Once a package
is published, it gets a single unique [address](/concepts/address) on the blockchain containing its modules'
bytecode. A published package becomes *immutable* and can be interacted with by sending
transactions.

```move
0x...  
    my_module: <bytecode>  
    another_module: <bytecode>
```
