# Sui Improvement Proposals (SIPs)

## What is SIP?

SIP stands for Sui Improvement Proposal. A SIP is a design document that details a new feature for Sui, its processes, or the ecosystem. It provides the basis for the Sui community to propose a new idea and to assess its merits, its feasability and the implementation details.

## How do I create a SIP?

Read the [contribution guidelines](/sui-foundation/sips/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where can I discuss SIPs?

* Discussions on active SIPs are located at <https://sips.sui.io/comments-active>
* Ideas for SIPs (pre-SIPs) are located at <https://sips.sui.io/comments-ideas>

## How do I provide feedback on the SIP process?

If you have comments regarding the SIP process, rather than with a specific SIP, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/issues/new/choose).
