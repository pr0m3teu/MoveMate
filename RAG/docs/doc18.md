# Account

An account is a way to identify a user. An account is generated from a private key, and is
identified by an address. An account can own objects, and can send transactions. Every transaction
has a sender, and the sender is identified by an [address](/concepts/address).

Sui supports multiple cryptographic algorithms for account generation. The two supported curves are
ed25519, secp256k1, and there is also a special way of generating an account - zklogin. The
cryptographic agility - the unique feature of Sui - allows for flexibility in the account
generation.
