## Security seamlessly integrated into your workflow

### [Prevent accidental secret exposure](https://github.com/security/advanced-security/secret-protection?locale=en-US)

![The image shows a terminal command and error message on a gradient blue background. The command is attempting to push code to a Git repository. The text reads: → ~/my_project git:(branch_name) git push remote: error GH009: Secrets detected! This push failed.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/3LPkaw75xR2vJxn85BMmWc/e04c21b3d6dc3c61692efa47e70c46c1/Image_8.webp?fm=webp)

Push protection automatically blocks secrets before they reach your repository, keeping code clean without disrupting workflows.

### [Find and fix vulnerabilities in your code](https://github.com/security/advanced-security/code-security?locale=en-US)

![The image displays a code snippet with an AI-suggested fix. The code is written in JavaScript and is shown on a blue gradient background. The original line of code, highlighted in red, reads: res.send('Hello ${req.query.name}!');. The AI-suggested fix, highlighted in green, reads: res.send('Hello ${escape(req.query.name)}!');. This change suggests using the escape function to sanitize the user input from req.query.name before sending it as part of the response.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/WgPz9OCdwhgULwNBa7tV0/0b500ea1952d17c549d6d21dba094e9b/Image_11.webp?fm=webp)
