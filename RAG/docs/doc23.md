# Primitive Types

For simple values, Move has a number of built-in primitive types. They're the foundation for all
other types. The primitive types are:

* [Booleans](#booleans)
* [Unsigned Integers](#integer-types)
* [Addresses](/move-basics/address) - covered in the next section

Before we get to the primitive types, let's first take a look at how to declare and assign variables
in Move.

## Variables and Assignment[​](#variables-and-assignment "Direct link to Variables and Assignment")

Variables are declared using the let keyword. They are immutable by default, but can be made
mutable by adding the mut keyword:

```move
let <variable_name>[: <type>]  = <expression>;  
let mut <variable_name>[: <type>] = <expression>;
```

Where:

* <variable\_name> - the name of the variable
* <type> - the type of the variable, optional
* <expression> - the value to be assigned to the variable

```move
let x: bool = true;  
let mut y: u8 = 42;
```

A mutable variable can be reassigned using the = operator.

```move
y = 43;
```

Variables can also be shadowed by re-declaring them.

```move
let x: u8 = 42;  
let x: u16 = 42;
```

## Booleans[​](#booleans "Direct link to Booleans")

The bool type represents a boolean value - yes or no, true or false. It has two possible values:
true and false, which are keywords in Move. For booleans, the compiler can always infer the type
from the value, so there is no need to explicitly specify it.

```move
let x = true;  
let y = false;
```

Booleans are often used to store flags and to control the flow of the program. Please refer to the
[Control Flow](/move-basics/control-flow) section for more information.

## Integer Types[​](#integer-types "Direct link to Integer Types")

Move supports unsigned integers of various sizes, from 8-bit to 256-bit. The integer types are:

* u8 - 8-bit
* u16 - 16-bit
* u32 - 32-bit
* u64 - 64-bit
* u128 - 128-bit
* u256 - 256-bit

```move
let x: u8 = 42;  
let y: u16 = 42;  
// ...  
let z: u256 = 42;
```

While boolean literals like true and false are clearly booleans, an integer literal like 42
could be any of the integer types. In most of the cases, the compiler will infer the type from the
value, usually defaulting to u64. However, sometimes the compiler is unable to infer the type and
will require an explicit type annotation. It can either be provided during assignment or by using a
type suffix.

```move
// Both are equivalent  
let x: u8 = 42;  
let x = 42u8;
```

### Operations[​](#operations "Direct link to Operations")

Move supports the standard arithmetic operations for integers: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). The syntax for these operations is:

| Syntax | Operation | Aborts If |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | addition | Result is too large for the integer type |
| - | subtraction | Result is less than zero |
| \* | multiplication | Result is too large for the integer type |
| % | modulus (remainder) | The divisor is 0 |
| / | truncating division | The divisor is 0 |

> For more operations, including bitwise operations, please refer to the
> [Move Reference](/reference/primitive-types/integers#bitwise).

The types of the operands *must match*, or the compiler will raise an error. The result of the
operation will be of the same type as the operands. To perform operations on different types, the
operands need to be cast to the same type.

### Casting with as[​](#casting-with-as "Direct link to casting-with-as")

Move supports explicit casting between integer types. The syntax is as follows:

```move
<expression> as <type>
```

Note that parentheses around the expression may be required to prevent ambiguity:

```move
let x: u8 = 42;  
let y: u16 = x as u16;  
let z = 2 * (x as u16); // ambiguous, requires parentheses
```

A more complex example, preventing overflow:

```move
let x: u8 = 255;  
let y: u8 = 255;  
let z: u16 = (x as u16) + ((y as u16) * 2);
```

### Overflow[​](#overflow "Direct link to Overflow")

Move does not support overflow / underflow; an operation that results in a value outside the range
of the type will raise a runtime error. This is a safety feature to prevent unexpected behavior.

```move
let x = 255u8;  
let y = 1u8;  
  
// This will raise an error  
let z = x + y;
```
