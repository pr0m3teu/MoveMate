[Sui 0.8.0 devnet release Latest](/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-0.8.0)

# Devnet-0.8.0

* **proposed date**: **2022-08-30**
* **release captain: Eugene**
* **the change-set for release:** [08f0c60](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commit/08f0c60092966e6c7668ed604cb2590ce5dac833)
* **docker image**: \*\*\*\*
* **version: 0.8.0**
* **released date**: **2022-08-30**

# Release Content

## Highlights

* Use our [Sui Explorer](https://sui.io/resources-sui/meet-the-sui-explorer/), re-designed with the user in mind.
* Learn about [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05677), which has replaced Tusk as the consensus component of the [Narwhal](https://github.com/MystenLabs/narwhal)-based [Sui consensus engine](https://docs.sui.io/learn/architecture/consensus).
* Interact with the Sui network via our [Rust SDK](https://docs.sui.io/build/rust-sdk).
* Employ [shared objects](https://docs.sui.io/build/objects#shared) with full support in Sui (first launched in June); for an example see: [Shared Object](https://examples.sui.io/basics/shared-object.html#shared-object)

### Move

* The `utf8.move` module is now deprecated in favor of the `string` module in `std` that has many of the same features.

### Tools and Ecosystem

* Explorer:
  + New [Sui Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/) home page with [validator table and fullnode map](https://docs.sui.io/explore/sui-explorer).
* Browser Extension Wallet:
  + Re-designed homepage and onboarding flow.
  + Human-readable transaction signing, which explicitly tells user what objects the transaction tries to touch and how they want to touch it: either read-only, modify, or transfer (meaning full-access, including transfer, destroy, etc.)

### Sui Core

* Event Query is now supported on fullnode. See the: [event\_api.rs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-json-rpc/src/event_api.rs#L122-L210)
* Fullnode integrates with Quorum Driver and has API exposed. WIP to fully replace gateway.
* Renamed follower route. Fullnodes need to do a full update to connect with validators.

### **Narwhal (selected Sui-relevant highlights)**

* Removed worker information from the committee. First step in dynamic worker integration in NW.
* Replaced the certificate\_store with a wrapper struct which will improve efficiency of scans for stored certificates by round
* Bug Fixes
  + Prevent infinite retries in case of non-transient network retries
  + Worker synchronizer to reply back for available batches
  + Make the executors channel capacity the same as the rest of the primary and make permits decrease the gauge on drop.

[Sui 0.7.0 devnet release](/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-0.7.0)

### Move

* Added keccak256 native function.
* Removed object version from Move structs. And renamed `sui::object::Info` to `sui::object::UID`
  + Sorry for the churn here. The intention of the `Info` renaming was to capture the fact that there was a unique ID alongside some other metadata. But with the removal of that metadata, this naming no longer makes much sense.
* Implemented one-time witness pattern.
  + This pattern can be used to guarantee a certain function is called at most once for a given type parameter. Thought it is highly constrained.
  + This will be used to guarantee there can be only one instance of a treasury cap for a given coin.

### Tools and Ecosystem

* Explorer
  + Added go-to-definition ability in the package view.
  + Re-designed object details view, address view, and transaction details view.
* Browser Extension Wallet
  + Re-designed NFT tabs, NFT details page, and NFT transfer page.
  + Re-designed activities page.
  + Display version number in the Settings menu.
  + Optimize transferring SUI token by combining coin split and transfer into one transaction.

### Sui Core

* Fixed memory leak in fullnodes.
* Fixed various bugs on validators: issues related to transfer SUI with insufficient gas balance; objects digest mismatch after a failed transaction. Improved error message clarity across the board.

### **Narwhal (selected Sui-relevant highlights)**

* Use Task groups to make sure we do not leave a node alive with some crashed key components.
* Batch retrieval now works even when batches are identical
* The Executor retrieves needed blocks in bulk, as opposed to one-by-one, and delivers them in the order they were sequenced, as opposed to the order they were received.
* Leader election now rotates over all the leaders, rather than half the roster[.](https://github.com/MystenLabs/narwhal/pull/762)
