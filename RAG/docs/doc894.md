## Protocol

#### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

## Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)

[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

## JSON-RPC

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass  
   watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting  
   from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its  
   starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all  
   pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,  
   `--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have  
   a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the  
   configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume  
   processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same  
   pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two  
   new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.  
   These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint  
   data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of  
   their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently  
   these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks  
   per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:

1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for *initial* ingestion of a  
   fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and  
   optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can  
   achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a  
   configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential  
   pipelines.

## GraphQL

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

[#23928](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23928): Removed `events` field from `SimulationResult`. Events are now only accessible via `effects.events()` to eliminate redundancy.

[#23929](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23929): Returns `null` for simulated/executed transactions timestamp as they are not included in a checkpoint.

[#24486](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24486): Validate types and fields passed into AvailableRange queries.

## CLI

[#24367](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24367):

* Refactored `sui validator` commands to use a shared  
  TxProcessingArgs  
  struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide  
  clearer instructions for offline signing.
