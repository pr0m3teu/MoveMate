## v1.62.0[​](#v1620 "Direct link to v1.62.0")

**🔶 Testnet** | *Source: [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/testnet-v1.62.0)*

Click to openSui v1.62 Gas Schedule Updates (and what to expect)

Sui v1.62 includes targeted gas schedule and metering fixes to more accurately account for the true execution cost and introduce a few new gas changes to reduce over-charging.

#### Summary of gas schedule changes[​](#summary-of-gas-schedule-changes "Direct link to Summary of gas schedule changes")

**Dynamic field changes (largest behavioral impact)**

Dynamic field operations now charge differently depending on cache status:

* **First load of a dynamic field** (i.e., not in the runtime cache, and not created in the transaction) is **more expensive**.
* **Subsequent loads of the same dynamic field within the transaction** are **significantly cheaper**.
* **Accessing dynamic fields created earlier in the same transaction** are **significantly cheaper.**

**Additional execution-level adjustments**

The following execution-level adjustments are being introduced:

* **`MoveLoc` is cheaper:** We previously (incorrectly) charged proportionally to value size, even though no value is created. We now charge a constant amount.
* **`ReadRef` is slightly more expensive:** This creates value copies, which we now account for.
* **Execution stack tracking:** More accurate stack-height metering reduces over-charging for some instructions.
* **Primitive size accounting tuning:** The computed “size” for several primitive types now better match their actual size, including some decreases and increases.

#### Observed impact from transaction sampling[​](#observed-impact-from-transaction-sampling "Direct link to Observed impact from transaction sampling")

We backtested several million transactions when examining these gas changes. Across a few million sampled transactions:

* **5.7%** saw a change in gas usage. Of that:
  + **1.3%** saw a gas **increase**
  + **4.4%** saw a gas **decrease**
* The **mean** change in gas costs across all transactions was **−6.03%**
* The **median** change in gas costs was **−21.52%**

Looking at the distribution among affected transactions:

* Up through about the **75th percentile**, changes are **net decreases** in gas costs.
* From the **76th percentile onward**, changes shift to **increases**.
* Extremes (0th/100th percentile) show larger swings, mostly explained by dynamic-field behavior interacting with size/caching.

#### What this means for developers[​](#what-this-means-for-developers "Direct link to What this means for developers")

For most workloads, you will notice no change (only 5.7% are affected from several million transactions). If you do, it is more likely to be a cost decrease.

#### Costly patterns[​](#costly-patterns "Direct link to Costly patterns")

Your transactions may be more expensive if they do **some or all** of the following:

* Read **many unique dynamic fields**
* The fields read are **large in size**
* Each field is read only a few times per transaction

This is because **first-time loads of uncached dynamic fields** are now **more expensive**.

#### Cheaper transactions[​](#cheaper-transactions "Direct link to Cheaper transactions")

Your transactions should get cheaper if they do **any** of the following:

* Read **a small set of dynamic fields repeatedly** within the same transaction
* **Create dynamic fields** and then access them again in-transaction

These now benefit from the cache-aware and “created in-transaction” discounts.

#### Secondary effects[​](#secondary-effects "Direct link to Secondary effects")

Most other instruction and stack-metering changes are modest, paving a path toward optimization in compilation. Over time, compiler work to prefer moving locals over copies wherever possible should allow the compiler to be able to take advantage of the reduced cost for `MoveLoc` that is introduced in these changes.

Click to openChanges to Non-`public` `entry` Functions in PTBs

In the next release (v1.62), there will be a new set of verification rules for arguments to non-`public` (either private or `public(package)`) `entry` functions. These rules will fully replace the existing rules, and in most cases will allow for more expressivity! This means that you can do more with `entry` functions than previously possible.

While we have received the feedback that most people do not understand the existing rules around `entry` functions, this post will not explain them since they are going away. Instead we'll focus on the new `entry` function rules going forward.

#### Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

For a brief overview, arguments to a non-`public` `entry` function cannot be entangled with a hot potato.
For example with the following code

```move
module ex::m;  
  
public struct HotPotato()  
  
public fun hot<T>(x: &mut Coin<T>): HotPotato { ... }  
entry fun spend<T>(x: &mut Coin<T>) { ... }  
public fun cool(h: HotPotato) { ... }
```

With an example PTB, this is invalid since the input coin to `spend` has an entangled hot potato when it is used with the `spend` function

```move
// Invalid PTB  
0: ex::m::hot(Input(0));  
1: ex::m::spend(Input(0)); // INVALID, Input(0) still hot via Result(0)  
2: ex::m::cool(Result(0));
```

However, it is valid if the hot potato is destroyed before `spend` is called.

```move
// Valid PTB  
0: ex::m::hot(Input(0));  
1: ex::m::cool(Result(0));  
2: ex::m::spend(Input(0)); // Valid! Input(0) is not hot
```

Below we will dig deeper into why these rules exist and how the rules are defined.

#### The New Rules[​](#the-new-rules "Direct link to The New Rules")

#### Motivation[​](#motivation "Direct link to Motivation")

You might wonder why have any rules for the usage of values with `entry` functions? The original motivation was to ensure that package developers had a way of ensuring a certain sense of “atomicity” for the arguments to their `entry` functions. Meaning a way of ensuring that the arguments would behave the same if the specific `entry` function was the only command in the PTB. A canonical example for this is flash loans—a developer might want to ensure that a given `Coin` is not from a flash loan and is ostensibly “owned” by the sender of the transaction.

In Move, flash loans (and similar paradigms) use [“hot potato”](https://move-book.com/programmability/hot-potato-pattern) patterns to force behavior.
For example

```move
module flash::loan;  
  
use sui::balance::Balance;  
use sui::sui::SUI;  
  
public struct Bank has key {  
    id: UID,  
    holdings: Balance<SUI>,  
}  
  
// This is a hot potato because it does not have `store` and does not have `drop`  
public struct Loan {  
    amount: u64,  
}  
  
public fun issue(bank: &mut Bank, amount: u64): (Balance<SUI>, Loan) {  
    assert!(bank.holdings.value() >= amount);  
    let loaned = bank.holdings.split(amount);  
    (loaned, Loan { amount })  
}  
  
public fun repay(bank: &mut Bank, loan: Loan, repayment: Balance<SUI>) {  
    let Loan { amount } = loan;  
    assert!(repayment.value() == amount);  
    bank.holdings.join(repayment);  
}
```

In this example, when `issue` is called, a `Loan` hot potato is created. In the PTB if `issue` is called, the transaction will not succeed unless the created `Loan` hot potato is destroyed by calling `repay`.

Our goal with non-public `entry` functions is to ensure that no argument is involved in such a flash loan (or similar hot potato) scenario. In other words, the arguments to a non-public `entry` function cannot be entangled in such a way to forces behavior in the PTB after the `entry` function is called. We will track this with an algorithm that tries to count how many hot potato values are active and what values they can influence.

#### Terminology[​](#terminology "Direct link to Terminology")

Some brief terminology before looking at the rules and their defining algorithm.

* The rules apply to the PTB *statically*. This means that the verification happens before the PTB begins execution. In some cases (particularly around shared objects), this will result in the rules seeming more general and pessimistic than they otherwise would be if they were applied *dynamically* as the PTB was executed.
* A *value* is any PTB `Argument`. These can be `Input`s, `Result`s, `NestedResult`s, or the `GasCoin` (already smashed).
* A *result* is a value that was returned from a PTB command. These are referred to via `Result` and `NestedResult`.
* Arguments to a PTB command have two usage types: by-reference (`&` or `&mut`) or by-value (either copied or moved).
* A value is considered *hot* if its type has neither `store` nor `drop`.
* This means a hot value’s type can be in one of the following cases:
  + No abilities
  + `copy`
  + `key`
  + Note that a value cannot have both `key` and `copy` since `sui::object::UID` does not have `copy`
* Each value belongs to a *clique*. A clique represents values that have been used together as arguments and their results.
* Each clique has a count with the number of hot values. Meaning that the clique’s count is incremented when results are hot (once per result), and the clique’s count is decremented when a hot value is moved (taken by-value and not copied).
  + The count here is tracking how many hot potato (or similar) values are outstanding, and the clique is tracking which values they could restrict or otherwise influence.

#### The Algorithm[​](#the-algorithm "Direct link to The Algorithm")

* Each input to the PTB starts off in its own clique with a count of zero.
* When values are used (by reference or by-value) together in a command, their cliques are merged, adding together each clique’s count.
* The count of the arguments’ merged clique is decremented for each hot value moved (taken by-value and not copied).
* If the command is a Move call for a non-public `entry` function, the count of the arguments’ merged clique must be zero at this point.
  + Note that this means a non-public `entry` function *can* take hot values! They must just be the last hot values in their clique.
* Results of each command are included in the arguments’ merged clique. The clique’s count is incremented for each hot result value.
* **NOTE:** Shared objects taken by-value have a special rule in that during the accounting for the result values, the argument’s merged clique’s count is set to infinity.
  + See the “Limitations” section below for more detail

#### Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

Walking through the example from the overview more carefully with the algorithm.
In these examples, we will walk through the algorithm, showing each clique and its count between each command.

```move
// Invalid PTB  
// Input 0: Coin<SUI>  
// cliques: { Input(0) } => 0  
0: ex::m::hot(Input(0));  
// cliques: { Input(0), Result(0) } = 1  
1: ex::m::spend(Input(0)); // INVALID, Input(0)'s clique has a count > 0  
2: ex::m::cool(Result(0));  
  
// Valid PTB  
// Input 0: Coin<SUI>  
// cliques: { Input(0) } => 0  
0: ex::m::hot(Input(0));  
// cliques: { Input(0), Result(0) } = 1  
1: ex::m::cool(Result(0));  
// cliques: { Input(0) } => 0  
2: ex::m::spend(Input(0)); // Valid! Input(0)'s clique has a count of 0
```

Using the `flash::loan` module from above, we can construct more involved examples

```move
// Invalid PTB  
// Input 0: flash::loan::Bank  
// Input 1: u64  
// cliques: { Input(0) } => 0, { Input(1) } =>  0,  
0: flash::loan::issue(Input(0), Input(1))  
// cliques: { Input(0), NestedResult(0,0), NestedResult(0,1) }  =>  1,  
1: sui::coin::from_balance(NestedResult(0,0));  
// cliques: { Input(0), NestedResult(0,1), Result(1) }  =>  1,  
2: ex::m::spend(Result(1)); // INVALID, Result(1)'s clique has count > 0  
3: sui::coin::into_balance(Result(1));  
4: flash::loan::repay(Result(3), NestedResult(0,1));
```

Even though the `Coin` created in command `1` was not directly involved in the flash loan in command `0`, its a part of a clique with a hot value `NestedResult(0,1)`. As such, it cannot be used in the private `entry` function `ex::m::spend`.

If the loan was repaid with `flash::loan::repay` before `ex::m::spend` was called, then this would be permitted (like we saw with the earlier example).

#### Limitations[​](#limitations "Direct link to Limitations")

As mentioned above, a clique with a shared object by-value is always hot. In other words, a non-public `entry` function can take a shared object by-value, but it cannot take a value in a clique that previously interacted with a shared object by value.

Why? This rule is needed since shared objects cannot be wrapped—they either have to be re-shared or deleted. This means that a shared-object could be used to force behavior in a way similar to a hot potato. But unlike a hot potato, we cannot tell from signature of the function if it is used properly.

If this algorithm was “dynamic” rather than “static”, it could be more precise at the cost of clarity. That is, a static set of rules is typically easier to describe and follow as compared to a dynamic set of rules. However, [party objects](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/objects/object-ownership/party) will fall under this restriction under more narrow cases than with shared objects. As such, we think that this restriction will be acceptable long term without having to sacrifice the clarity of the static system.

#### Coming Soon (v1.63 or later)[​](#coming-soon-v163-or-later "Direct link to Coming Soon (v1.63 or later)")

In a later version, we will remove the signature restrictions for `entry` functions. This means that *any* Move function can become `entry`!

#### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `104`[​](#sui-protocol-version-in-this-release-104 "Direct link to sui-protocol-version-in-this-release-104")

[#24239](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24239): 104 - update CoinMetadata post updates in Coin in 103

#### Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)[​](#nodes-validators-and-full-nodes "Direct link to Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)")

[#24420](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24420): Disable using Quorum Driver for transaction submission. Setting `TRANSACTION_DRIVER` env var is now a no-op.

#### JSON-RPC[​](#json-rpc "Direct link to JSON-RPC")

[#23737](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/23737): This PR, in tandem with [[#24192](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24192)]([#2419](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/2419)2), unifies how indexers determine their ingestion starting point and introduce watermark-gated backfill tasks.

1. `--skip-watermark` is removed, and the previous ability to bypass
   watermark safety checks for concurrent pipelines is no longer supported.
2. `--first-checkpoint` no longer forces the indexer to start ingesting
   from the configured checkpoint. The indexer now always determines its
   starting ingestion point as the minimum next checkpoint across all
   pipelines to resume processing from. From this release,
   `--first-checkpoint` now only applies to pipelines that do not yet have
   a committer watermark. These pipelines will resume processing from the
   configured value. Pipelines with existing watermarks will always resume
   processing from their own next checkpoint.
3. A new mechanism, watermark tasks, allows operators to run the same
   pipelines on multiple indexer instances for historical backfilling. Two
   new flags, `--task` and `--reader-interval-ms`, enable this mechanism.
   These flags create a tasked indexer whose pipelines commit checkpoint
   data as long as the checkpoint is not below the `reader_lo` watermark of
   their corresponding main pipelines. The indexer controls how frequently
   these tasked pipelines poll the main pipelines' watermarks
   per `--reader-interval-ms`.

Migration guidance:

1. If you use `--first-checkpoint` only for *initial* ingestion of a
   fresh pipeline, no further action is needed.
2. If you previously used `--first-checkpoint` and
   optionally `--skip-watermark` to backfill existing tables, you can
   achieve the same workflow by starting a new indexer instance with a
   configured `--task`, `--reader-interval-ms`, and `--first-checkpoint`.
3. Like `--skip-watermark`, `--task` cannot be used to run sequential
   pipelines.

[#24319](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24319): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).

  struct for transaction arguments, improving consistency with `sui client`. Updated `serialize_unsigned_transaction` help text to provide
  clearer instructions for offline signing.

[#20453](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20453): Adds /all\_historical\_volume and /orderbook/:pool\_name endpoints to the DeepBook Indexer API. /all\_historical\_volume retrieves the pools stored in the database and returns the volume for all pools within a time range. /orderbook/:pool\_name retrieves the level and depth of the requested order book pool. The PR also updates the /get\_historical\_volume/:pool\_id endpoint to read /historical\_volume/pool\_name.

[#20504](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20504): Adds a get\_net\_deposits endpoint to the DeepBook Indexer API.

This allows building to proceed without a network connection or active environment, but it will not be able to automatically determine the addresses of its dependencies. NB: `--ignore-chain` depends on `--dump-bytecode-as-base64`, so it cannot be used on its own.

[#17115](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/17115): Move will now lint against certain binary operations where the operands are identical, non-value expressions.

[#20498](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/20498): Compiler may generate slightly different errors as a result of the compilation process being more permissive with respect to parsing errors
