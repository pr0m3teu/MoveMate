## New u16, u32, u256 types in Sui-Move

* In addition to `u8`, `u64`, `u128`, Sui-Move now supports 3 additional unsigned integer types

  + `u16`: for 16 bit unsigned integers, example `12356u16`
  + `u32`: for 32 bit unsigned integers, example `12345678u32`
  + `u256`: for 256 bit unsigned integers, example `1234567890129463492427367372u256`

  VSCode Move-analyzer, and Emacs Major Mode have been updated to support these types, so we recommend updating your editor.  
  Update to latest Sui binaries to avoid compatibility issues.

if you run a fullnode using docker make sure to reset the db/volume using:  
`docker compose down -v`  
and if building and running from source then remove the fullnode db directory:  
`rm -rf /data/authorities_db/full_node_db` (or whatever you have configured)

[Sui v0.12.2 devnet release](/MystenLabs/sui/releases/tag/devnet-0.12.2)

**Flat VM Fees: Updated**

In 0.12.0, we rolled out Flat VM Fees, but quickly got feedback that this was too restrictive for some users who needed more room for computation. If we increased the gas limit for these users, we would inherently tax other users with lesser needs.  
So instead we have decided to revert to fine-grained charging per instruction while we improve the gas logic to be fair, predictable, and frictionless.  
Please keep the feedback coming.

See **Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commits/devnet-0.12.2>

# Devnet-0.9.0

* **proposed date**: **2022-09-06**
* **release captain: Eugene**
* **the change-set for release:** [11f5fd9](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/commit/11f5fd95a522f325c64bfc74b4ca0b6750f3bd92)
* **docker image**: \*\*\*\*
* **version: 0.9.0**
* **released date**: **2022-09-06**

# Release Content

## Highlights

### **Narwhal (selected Sui-relevant highlights)**

* Executor improvements:
  + A restarted executor restores its pending certificates
  + Better cleanup of the temporary batch store of the executor
* Narwhal supports & uses signature aggregation / compression,
* Various utilities (serializable ExecutionState, printable tracking\_id for some transactions)

### **Sui Explorer**

* The display of truncated transaction addresses has been optimized by replacing three dots (`...`) with the Unicode ellipsis, enabling more info to be shown in a smaller space.
* The amount of Sui Transferred has been added for every transaction in the Transaction for ID tables.
* We are no longer accepting new validator applications so the link to the validator application page has been removed.
* The website title has been updated from SuiExplorer to Sui Explorer.
* e2e tests against localnet have been enabled.
* The Tailwind deprecation warnings have been removed.
* Every merge to main branch now triggers a deploy of the website to <https://explorer.ci.sui.io/>.
