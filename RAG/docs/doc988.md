[#22611](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22611): Improve error messages around type resolution.

## Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)

[#22572](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22572): support path-based remote-store options for fullnode state sync fallback

[#22594](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22594): No noticeable impact to users

## gRPC

[#22435](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22435): Implementing GetPackage, GetModule, GetFunction, and GetDatatype APIs

[#22525](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22525): Implementing ListPackageVersions API for MovePackageService

[#22560](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22560): Speeding up index initialization by accumulating batches of balance updates in memory.

[#22619](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22619): Tune rocksdb for index initialization.

## CLI

[#22530](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22530): `sui keytool export` to show the `alias` field correctly.

[#22528](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22528): `sui move build` --dump-bytecode-as-base64`is now working correctly due to a bug in the logic when a`Move.lock` file existed with the published address.

Adds an existing hardcoded bound to the protocol config  
for clarity.

per-epoch configs accessed in the transaction.

enables Party objects (and associated `party_transfer`  
functions) in testnet

## CLI

[#22332](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22332):  
Update test names used for filtering in Move unit tests so  
the fully-qualified name is used to match against (i.e.,  
`testing::a::test_name` instead of `a::test_name`). Also add support for  
regexes to be used for test filtering rather than just substring  
matching.

[#22303](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22303):  
Update the package summary generation to make them more  
portable.

[#22350](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22350):  
Improved initial clones times for Move packages that are git  
dependencies.

## Protocol

#### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `85`

[#22173](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22173): Allow larger objects to be created by system transactions

[#22353](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22353): Congestion control settings have been adjusted

## Nodes (Validators and Full nodes)

[#22143](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22143): DoS protection is enabled in dryRun mode by default for validators

## gRPC

[#21896](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21896): Implements the wait\_for\_effects gRPC API on validators to support the second query for mysticeti-fastpath that is waiting for effects on a validator. A status cache is introduced to remember the current consensus status for each consensus position (instead of the transaction digest). When waiting for effects, acquire the first status update to ensure that it is not rejected by consensus, then wait for effects while making sure it is not eventually rejected post-commit. In the new request, use a single boolean include\_details to indicate whether to get all detailed data, including effects itself, instead of using individual booleans.

[#22197](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22197): Enables TLS on connections to validators over the gRPC interface.

## JSON-RPC

[#21932](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/21932): returns additional error information when an abort error occurs.

## CLI

[#22166](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22166): Added the `-c` short flag for the `sui client upgrade` command to pass the upgrade capability.

[#22139](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22139): Add default TLS to sui-tool with optional --no-tls flag

[#22293](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/22293): Added a new `--sender` argument for transactions to set the sender to a specific address.
