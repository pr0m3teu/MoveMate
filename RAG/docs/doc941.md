## Description

This change introduces the ability to chunk execution time estimates so we can store and load more estimates across the epoch boundary.

## Test plan

New e2e test validates that chunked estimates survive epoch transition and that they are written to the system state object.

you can prob use the constants directly (as is done above), rather than adding a second local name for them

given that we have other maximums in the protocol configs like `max_tx_size_bytes` and `max_pure_argument_size`, does this actually work without triggering other invariant violations? maybe those aren't checked for end-of-epoch tx and so it's fine? but if they are, this might need to be structured so that each chunk is saved in its own tx

We may want to follow up with [@mystenmark](https://github.com/mystenmark) about this re: the structure of the end-of-epoch tx and how many components we can add to it, if they all end up in the same PTB

System txns are exempt from max\_tx\_size\_bytes with a 128kb limit. They instead have an 8MB limit for transaction effects and a 50MB limit for written objects.

max\_pure\_argument\_size is a different matter; will need to figure out how to address this

Confirming that max\_pure\_argument\_size is also bypassed for end of epoch transactions. It seems that our 8 mb constraint is the main one we need to be concerned with.

having defaults here that don't make sense if the mode is not ETE feels kind of weird. maybe these accessors should return `Option`s? or can they even be deleted? fine if they're more convenient to have, but none of the other ETE params have accessors

curious how did you pick 18 and 180?

Max object size threshold we were hitting is 250kb, so that's our upper bound for space required by 18 estimates, times 10 (current config) would be 2.5 MB. Our next threshold of concern is max\_serialized\_tx\_effects\_size\_bytes\_system\_tx, which is 8 MB, including all fx written by end\_of\_epoch

the \_v1 in the suffix of `filter_and_sort_v1` refers to the `V1` variant of the `StoredExecutionTimeObservations` enum, so here it is a bit confusing to me that a function with `_v2` in the name actually still returns the `V1` enum variant. maybe call it `filter_sort_and_chunk_v1` or something? (that's a mouthful, so, open to other ideas)

ignore this question if it's moot after other requested changes. however just so I don't forget:

it looks like the flow as currently implemented first calls `filter_and_sort_v1` when setting up the end-of-epoch tx, and then later calls the below to do chunking. in which case, is it necessary to filter and sort a second time?

This is missing the case where `enable_observation_chunking` was just enabled in the current epoch, so the previous epoch ended with it off and saved it with the old style, but now we are starting up the new epoch with `enable_observation_chunking == true` and you still need to read the old-style contents.
