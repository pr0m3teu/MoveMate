[Developer Announcements](/c/announcements/dev-ann/31)
There are plenty of places to get news about Sui: Twitter, Discord, Telegram, the Sui Foundation Blog, even Reddit or Youtube. But although those are all great ways to get news, they tend to get you a lot of news. If you just want to know what changes are coming that might impact what you’re building, how are you going to keep track?
