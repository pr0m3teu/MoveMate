## Integrate AI-powered security features directly into your development workflow, eliminating the need for third-party tools.

### Code scanning

Find and fix security issues before production with static application security testing (SAST).

### Secret scanning

Hunt, revoke, and prevent leaked secrets with automatic push protection.

### Supply chain security

Keep vulnerable dependencies out of your applications with software composition analysis (SCA).

### Give AI the heavy lifting

Organizations struggle to fix their backlog of vulnerabilities, despite the risks. Coming next, security managers can burn down years of security debt in one simple sprint.
