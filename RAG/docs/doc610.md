## Accelerate migration and modernization with GitHub Copilot by reducing manual, platform-specific coding.

### Java and .NET upgrades

Upgrade language runtime versions and frameworks effortlessly with AI-driven remediation and automated error fixes—no more dependency headaches.

### End-to-end migration

From assessment to deployment, simplify the migration journey with full visibility, control, and predictability, while delivering higher quality outcomes.

### Cloud ready

Make apps cloud-ready by resolving compatibility issues, reducing technical debt, and strengthening security while unlocking the full power of Azure services.

### Let AI do the heavy lifting

Copilot analyzes codebases, surfaces blockers, and suggests fixes—automating repetitive steps and reducing tech debt so developers can focus on higher value work.

### A smoother upgrade path

Upgrade .NET and Java runtimes and frameworks with guided remediation that updates configs, libraries, and dependencies.

### Stay in control

Every recommendation is reviewable and every change is validated through your tests and pipelines. Built-in security checks catch CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) early, ensuring alignment with your standards and policies.
