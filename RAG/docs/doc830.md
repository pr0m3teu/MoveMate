### GitHub Advisory Database

While CVEs identify vulnerabilities, they don’t tell the whole
story. Entries in the GitHub Advisory database expand beyond
identification to include additional context and details to
support automated security tooling – sourced from a global
community of security experts and curated by the Security Lab – to
help you understand vulnerabilities, assess risk, and fix with
confidence and efficiency.
