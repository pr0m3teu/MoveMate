### Reduce security debt

GitHub Code Security continuously scans your code as you build, helping detect vulnerabilities early, fix them fast with Copilot Autofix, and ship securely.

![The image displays a dashboard for an SQL injection (CWE-89) campaign aimed at remediating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The dashboard has three main sections: Campaign progress, Status, and Copilot Autofix.

In the Campaign progress section, it shows 97% completion with 701 alerts, where 701 are closed and 13 are in progress. It also notes that the campaign started 20 days ago.

The Status section indicates there are 7 days left until the deadline on November 15, 2024.

The Copilot Autofix section mentions that there are 670 supported alerts and provides information about how Copilot Autofix can help fix these alerts automatically.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/3XtStULvvadAF4bh8QBOHc/df209619dbd649d798f086b7b271197b/Image_Area__60_40__8.webp)

### Catch risks early

Identify new dependencies and check for vulnerabilities or license issues with the Dependency Review Action.

[Explore the Dependency Review Action](https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)

![The image shows a "Dependency Review" report generated by the GitHub Actions bot. The report lists the following issues: 0 vulnerable packages, 1 package with incompatible licenses,  and 0 packages with unknown licenses. Each issue has a "Details" link next to it for more information.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/6CfGDEPnMef4Ww2bXpCpSH/88ea64c30d6b98119e6bc4bae6c4f008/Image_Area__60_40__9.webp)

### FAQs

#### What is Code Security?

GitHub Code Security empowers developers to secure their code without sacrificing speed. With built-in static analysis, AI-powered remediation, advanced dependency scanning, and proactive vulnerability management, teams can automatically detect, prioritize, and remediate security issues, all within their existing GitHub workflow—allowing them to deliver secure software faster and with greater confidence

#### What is Copilot Autofix?

Copilot Autofix uses AI-powered code suggestions to automatically fix security vulnerabilities identified by CodeQL. When a security vulnerability is detected, Copilot Autofix analyzes the code context, understands the underlying security issue, and generates a precise, contextually appropriate fix. This feature bridges the gap between vulnerability detection and remediation, enabling developers to review and apply AI-suggested fixes directly within their workflow.

#### What are Security Campaigns?

Security campaigns provide a structured framework for planning, tracking, and implementing security fixes across multiple repositories and teams allowing you to systematically burn down security debt. With With security campaigns, security teams can group related vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, assign ownership, and monitor progress through a unified dashboard. Security campaigns can be organized by vulnerability type, security initiative, compliance requirement, or any other logical grouping to coordinate security improvements at scale.

#### What is dependency analysis?

Dependency review scans pull requests for vulnerable dependencies before they're introduced into your codebase. It evaluates the security impact of dependency changes, identifying vulnerable packages and their severity levels to prevent security issues from being merged. The tool shows detailed dependency changes by comparing the base and head branches, highlighting added, removed, and updated dependencies along with their known vulnerabilities

#### What is EPSS?

Dependabot alerts now feature the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) from the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), helping better assess vulnerability risks. EPSS helps organizations prioritize vulnerability remediation by predicting the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the next 30 days. It provides a score ranging from 0 to 1 (0-100%), alongside a percentile ranking to indicate how the vulnerability compares to others.
