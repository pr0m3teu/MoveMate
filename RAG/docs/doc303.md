# Sui Move CLI

The Sui CLI `move` command provides several commands for working with Move source code. A typical usage of `sui move` is to compile and test the Move code, or to generate a new Move project by using `sui move new project_name`, which creates the needed directories and the `Move.toml` file.

## Check Sui CLI installation[​](#check-sui-cli-installation "Direct link to Check Sui CLI installation")

Before you can use the Sui CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```move
$ sui --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Sui CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Sui](/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to get the Sui CLI on your system.

## Examples[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples")

The following examples demonstrate some of the most often used commands.

### Create a new Move project[​](#create-a-new-move-project "Direct link to Create a new Move project")

To create a new Move project that automatically adds the necessary dependencies in a `Move.toml` file, run `sui move new [<PROJECT-NAME>]`.

```move
$ sui move new smart_contract_test
```

```move
$ ls -l smart_contract_test
```

```move
Move.toml  
Sources
```

Display the contents of Move.toml file.

```move
$ cat smart_contract_test/Move.toml
```

```move
[package]  
name = "smart_contract_test"  
version = "0.0.1"  
  
[dependencies]  
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "framework/testnet" }  
  
[addresses]  
smart_contract_test = "0x0"
```

### Build a Move project[​](#build-a-move-project "Direct link to Build a Move project")

Use `sui move build` at the root of your Move project to build the package.

```move
$ sui move build
```

```move
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git  
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui  
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib  
BUILDING smart_contract_test
```

### Run tests in a Move project[​](#run-tests-in-a-move-project "Direct link to Run tests in a Move project")

Use `sui move test` to run the tests in a Move package.

```move
$ sui move test
```

```move
UPDATING GIT DEPENDENCY https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git  
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui  
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib  
BUILDING smart_contract_test  
Running Move unit tests  
Test result: OK. Total tests: 0; passed: 0; failed: 0
```

### Get test coverage for a module[​](#get-test-coverage-for-a-module "Direct link to Get test coverage for a module")

caution

This command currently only works on debug builds of the CLI. Please build the CLI from source to use it.

This example uses [`first_package`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/examples/move/first_package) Move package.

To get a summary of the test coverage, you must first run the `sui move test --coverage` command, and then the `sui move coverage summary --test` to get a summary of the test coverage in the example project.

```move
$ sui move test --coverage
```

```move
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui  
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib  
BUILDING first_package  
Running Move unit tests  
[ PASS    ] 0x0::example::test_module_init  
[ PASS    ] 0x0::example::test_sword_transactions  
Test result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0  
  
$ sui move coverage summary --test  
+-------------------------+  
| Move Coverage Summary   |  
+-------------------------+  
Module 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000::example  
>>> % Module coverage: 92.81  
+-------------------------+  
| % Move Coverage: 92.81  |  
+-------------------------+
```

## Help[​](#help "Direct link to Help")

Each command has its own help section. For example:

```move
$ sui move build --help
```

```move
Usage: sui move build [OPTIONS]  
  
Options:  
  -p, --path <PACKAGE_PATH>  
          Path to a package which the command should be run with respect to  
      --with-unpublished-dependencies  
          Include the contents of packages in dependencies that haven't been published (only  
          relevant when dumping bytecode as base64)  
      --dump-bytecode-as-base64  
          Whether we are printing in base64  
      --ignore-chain  
          [Mainly for testing, not recommended for production] Don't specialize the package to the  
          active chain when dumping bytecode as Base64. This allows building to proceed without a  
          network connection or active environment, but it will not be able to automatically  
          determine the addresses of its dependencies  
  -d, --dev  
          Compile in 'dev' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used if  
          this flag is set. This flag is useful for development of packages that expose named  
          addresses that are not set to a specific value  
      --generate-struct-layouts  
          If true, generate struct layout schemas for all struct types passed into `entry` functions  
          declared by modules in this package These layout schemas can be consumed by clients (e.g.,  
          the TypeScript SDK) to enable serialization/deserialization of transaction arguments and  
          events  
      --test  
          Compile in 'test' mode. The 'dev-addresses' and 'dev-dependencies' fields will be used  
          along with any code in the 'tests' directory  
      --doc  
          Generate documentation for packages  
      --disassemble  
          Save disassembly for generated bytecode along with bytecode maps (source maps for  
          disassembled bytecode)  
      --install-dir <INSTALL_DIR>  
          Installation directory for compiled artifacts. Defaults to current directory  
      --force  
          Force recompilation of all packages  
      --fetch-deps-only  
          Only fetch dependency repos to MOVE_HOME  
      --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps  
          Skip fetching latest git dependencies  
      --default-move-flavor <DEFAULT_FLAVOR>  
          Default flavor for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config  
      --default-move-edition <DEFAULT_EDITION>  
          Default edition for move compilation, if not specified in the package's config  
      --dependencies-are-root  
          If set, dependency packages are treated as root packages. Notably, this will remove  
          warning suppression in dependency packages  
      --silence-warnings  
          If set, ignore any compiler warnings  
      --warnings-are-errors  
          If set, warnings become errors  
      --json-errors  
          If set, reports errors at JSON  
      --no-lint  
          If `true`, disable linters  
      --lint  
          If `true`, enables extra linters  
      --mode <MODE>  
          Arbitrary mode -- this will be used to enable or filter user-defined `#[mode(<MODE>)]`  
          annotations during compilation  
  -h, --help  
          Print help  
  -V, --version
