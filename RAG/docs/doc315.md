# Move References

Move is an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects (sometimes referred to as *smart contracts*). Move is a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move is adaptable to meet the needs of the blockchain the code operates on, see [Move on Sui](/concepts/sui-move-concepts#differences) to review enhancements made to Move for optimization on the Sui blockchain.
