## Protocol

#### Sui Protocol Version in this release: `103`

[#24343](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24343): framework changes to coin.move

## gRPC

[#24244](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24244): Return "Not Found" for new checkpoints that haven't been fully stored yet instead of "Internal Error."

## GraphQL

[#24202](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24202): Fixes a bug related to paginating object versions for an object that has been deleted/wrapped at some point.

[#24325](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/pull/24325): Fixes a bug where the transaction payloads that were part of `simulateTransaction` calls were incorrectly classified as part of the query payload (and therefore subject to a lower payload size limit).
