# Address

Address is a unique identifier of a location on the blockchain. It is used to identify
[packages](/concepts/packages), [accounts](/concepts/what-is-an-account), and [objects](/object/object-model).
Address has a fixed size of 32 bytes and is usually represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed
with 0x. Addresses are case insensitive.

```move
0xe51ff5cd221a81c3d6e22b9e670ddf99004d71de4f769b0312b68c7c4872e2f1
```

The address above is an example of a valid address. It is 64 characters long (32 bytes) and prefixed
with 0x.

Sui also has reserved addresses that are used to identify standard packages and objects. Reserved
addresses are typically simple values that are easy to remember and type. For example, the address
of the Standard Library is 0x1. Addresses, shorter than 32 bytes, are padded with zeros to the
left.

```move
0x1 = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

Here are some examples of reserved addresses:

* 0x1 - address of the Sui Standard Library (alias std)
* 0x2 - address of the Sui Framework (alias sui)
* 0x6 - address of the system Clock object

> You can find all reserved addresses in the [Appendix B](/appendix/reserved-addresses).
