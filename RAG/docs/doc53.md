# Using Objects

In the [Object Model](/object) chapter, we introduced the shift in the Move language from an
account-based model to an object-based one. This chapter takes a closer look at that model. You’ll
learn how objects work and how to put them to use in your Sui applications.

If you haven’t read the [Object Model](/object) chapter yet, we recommend starting there before
continuing.
