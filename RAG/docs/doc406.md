GitHub Accelerator 2024

# Powering AI advancements in the open

[Meet the selected projects](#cohort)[Sign up for updates](https://forms.gle/oi167pL6d2oUkjtL6)

## Advancing AI

This year's theme and cohort is about projects who are making AI advancements but in the open. We are looking for people and projects that are building AI-based solutions with an open source license and community to improve the world. With the GitHub Accelerator, we want to pioneer new ways for developers to simply and sustainably work in open source full-time – built on developer's terms.

## The Program

### Programming and Visibility

Participants engage in a 10-week peer-based cohort program that includes instruction, workshops, and expert speakers. Participants will have the opportunity to amplify through GitHub channels, events and showcases.

### Collaboration and Community

Participants will have a diverse community of builders to learn from within the cohort to exchange ideas, build partnerships, and accelerate project growth and adoption.

### Mentorship and Support

The program will offer mentorship from community and Hubbers in fields of open source, AI, Security as well as topical areas like fundraising and business.
